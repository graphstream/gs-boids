 * A boid is both a particle in the forces system used to compute the position
 * and motion of the object, and a GraphStream node. This allows to consider a
 * graph made of all the boids.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The boid is in fact split in two parts, the {@link Boid} class itself that
 * represents the boid in the forces system. The boid particle in turn contains
 * a {@link BoidForces} object that represents all the forces exercising on the
 * boid. Globally, the {@link Boid} class acts on the graph and updates its
 * position, creating links toward other boids/nodes that it sees, whereas the
 * {@link BoidForces} are used to compute the boid position.
